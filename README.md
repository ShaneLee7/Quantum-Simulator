# Quantum Computer Simulator

A modular quantum computer simulator written in C that supports up to 20 qubits. This implementation demonstrates fundamental quantum computing concepts whilst maintaining simplicity and educational value.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns across multiple modules
- **Up to 20 Qubits**: Simulate quantum systems with 1-20 qubits
- **Common Quantum Gates**: Pauli gates, Hadamard, CNOT, and more
- **Quantum Circuits**: Build and execute quantum circuits
- **Measurement**: Single qubit and full state measurements
- **Educational**: Well-documented and straightforward implementation

## Building

```bash
make
```

## Running

```bash
./quantum_simulator
```

## Module Overview

- **quantum_state**: Core quantum state representation and operations
- **quantum_gates**: Implementation of common quantum gates
- **complex_math**: Complex number arithmetic
- **quantum_circuit**: Circuit management and execution
- **quantum_utils**: Utilities and helper functions

## Example Usage

The simulator includes examples of:
- Bell state creation
- Quantum superposition
- Entanglement demonstrations
- Basic quantum algorithms

## Limitations

- Maximum 20 qubits (due to memory constraints of 2^20 amplitudes)
- Classical simulation (not actual quantum hardware)
- Double precision floating point arithmetic# Quantum-Simulator
